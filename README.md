# BruteDuck

I have created a python script, which takes custom parameters (set by the user) and uses them to generate a text file that contains a "DuckyScript" based script, that can be used to brute-force any plain text password. In other words, guessing the correct input (password) until it gets it right. It's the equivalent of you typing all possible passwords into a login panel until you get it right, just faster.

Features:\
  -Customizable string.\
  -Customizable string length.\
  -Customizable delay between actions.

# Bonus

Another tool that generates a random string containing numbers which I used for testing the rubber ducky.

Features:\
  -Build in timer
  
  # Note
  I strongly recommend using the "DEFAULT" version if you own an original Rubber Ducky. The size of the generated script is reduced more  than double due to using the "DEFAULT_DELAY" command. I made two separate versions because I don't own an original device and because I want the tool to be available to as much people as possible.
