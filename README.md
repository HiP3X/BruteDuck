# BruteDuck

A python script that creates another script based on the "Ducky Script" language to be used on a Ruber Ducky.\
The script created can be used to execute a "Brute Force" attack on given target.

Features:\
  -Customizable string.\
  -Customizable string length.\
  -Customizable delay between actions.

# Bonus

Another tool that generates a random string containing numbers which I used for testing.

Features:\
  -Build in timer
  
  # Note
  I strongly recommend using the "DEFAULT" version if you own an original Rubber Ducky. The size of the generated script is reduced more  then double duo to using the "DEFAULT_DELAY" command. I made two separate versions because I don't own an original device and because I want the tool to be available to as much people as possible.
